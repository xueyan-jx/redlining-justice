## Library and data preparation

### 1. Load libraries and data



```{r}
#| code-fold: true

# Load libraries

# Filter ejscreen to LA county
LA <- ejscreen %>%
  dplyr::filter(CNTY_NAME %in% c("Los Angeles County"))
```



### 2. Check and transform coordinate reference systems



```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Check if coordinate reference systems (CRS) match
if((st_crs(LA) == st_crs(HOLC_grade)) && 
   (st_crs(LA) == st_crs(gbif_birds_LA))){
  print("all match!")
}else{
  print("not match")
}

```

```{r}
# Transform CRS so that they can match each other
LA_trans <- st_transform(LA, crs = st_crs(HOLC_grade))
```

```{r}
# Test the match of CRS again
match_test_result <- expect_true(all(st_crs(LA_trans) == st_crs(HOLC_grade) & 
                 st_crs(HOLC_grade) == st_crs(gbif_birds_LA)))
```



### 3. Check the validity of geometries and make geometry valid if it is invalid



```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if(all(st_is_valid(HOLC_grade))){
  print("geometry is valid")
}else{
  HOLC_grade_valid <- st_make_valid(HOLC_grade)
  }
```



## Part 1: Legacy of redlining in current environmental (in)justice

The United States has a long history of racial segregation which is still visible. The "redlining" of neighborhoods has had wide consequences for community wealth and health (Gee, 2008).

**Objective:** Explore historical redlining in Los Angeles and its legacy on present-day environmental justice.

### 1. Extract base map information from Open Street Map (OSM) data



```{r}
# Download base map from OSM of the bounding box
background_data <- tmaptools::read_osm(sf::st_bbox(HOLC_grade_valid))
```



### 2. Map of historical redlining neighborhoods



```{r}
#| code-fold: true
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(background_data) + 
  tm_rgb() + 
tm_shape(HOLC_grade_valid) +
  tm_polygons(col = "grade",
              palette = viridisLite::viridis(4),
              title = "HOLC grade",
              border.col = NA,
              alpha = 0.8) +
  tm_credits("Â© OpenStreetMap contributors",
             position=c("right", "bottom")) +
  tm_layout(legend.text.size = 0.85,
            legend.title.size = 1.2,
            legend.text.fontface = "bold",
            legend.title.fontface = "bold",
            legend.outside = TRUE,
            legend.outside.position = ("right"),
            legend.outside.size = 0.24) +
tm_scale_bar(position = c(0,0),
             breaks = c(0,5,10,15)) +
tm_compass(position = c(0,0.8),
           size = 1.3)
```

### 3. Summarize the percent of current census block groups within each HOLC grade (or none)



```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# Join HOLC grade information to ejscreen data of LA 
HOLC_grade_LA <- st_join(LA_trans, HOLC_grade_valid)

# Filter joined dataset to target columns
HOLC_grade_LA_filtered <- HOLC_grade_LA %>%
  select("ID", "grade", "LOWINCPCT", "P_PM25","P_LIFEEXPPCT")
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# Summarize the percent of current census block groups within each HOLC grade (or none)
summary_HOLC_grade <- HOLC_grade_LA_filtered %>%
  group_by(grade) %>%
  summarize(percentage = percent(n()/nrow(HOLC_grade_LA_filtered))) %>%
  st_drop_geometry()

# Display the summary table
kable(summary_HOLC_grade, col.names = c("Grade", "Percentage"), caption = "Table 1 The Percent of Census Block Groups within Each HOLC Grade (or none)")
```



### 4. Summarize and plot mean % low income, mean percentile for PM2.5, and mean percentile for low life expectancy within each HOLC grade (or none)



```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| code-fold: true

# Summarize mean % low income within each HOLC grade (or none)
summary_LowIncomePct <- HOLC_grade_LA_filtered %>%
  group_by(grade) %>%
  summarize(low_income = 100 * mean(LOWINCPCT, na.rm = TRUE), 
            .groups = 'drop')

# Summarize mean percentile for Particulate Matter 2.5 within each HOLC grade (or none)
summary_PPM2.5 <- HOLC_grade_LA_filtered %>%
  group_by(grade) %>%
  summarize(PM2.5 = mean(P_PM25, na.rm = TRUE), 
            .groups = 'drop')

# Summarize mean percentile for low life expectancy within each HOLC grade (or none)
summary_LifeExpPct <- HOLC_grade_LA_filtered %>%
  group_by(grade) %>%
  summarize(P_LifeExpPct = mean(P_LIFEEXPPCT, na.rm = TRUE), 
            .groups = 'drop')
```

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
#| code-fold: true
# Plot the above summary information

Plot_LOWINCPCT <- 
  ggplot(summary_LowIncomePct, 
         aes(x = grade, y = low_income, fill = "Mean % Low Income")) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(y = "Mean % Low Income") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = "skyblue", name = "") +
  theme_minimal() +

        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 8, face = "bold"),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 8, face = "bold"))
 
Plot_PPM2.5 <- 
  ggplot(summary_PPM2.5, 
         aes(x = grade, y = PM2.5, fill = "Mean Percentile for PM2.5")) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(y = "Mean Percentile for PM2.5") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = "grey", name = "") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), # delete x label
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 8, face = "bold"),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 8, face = "bold"))

  ggplot(summary_LifeExpPct, 
         aes(x = grade, y = P_LifeExpPct, fill = "Mean Percentile for Low Life Expectancy")) +

  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = 8, face = "bold"),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 8, face = "bold"))

# Combine the plots and align legend
combined_plot <- (Plot_LOWINCPCT / Plot_PPM2.5 / Plot_LifeExpPct) +
  plot_layout(guides = "collect",
              heights = c(1, 1, 1)) +
  theme(legend.position = "right", 
        legend.justification = "right", 
        legend.text = element_text(hjust = 0),
        plot.margin = margin(20, 20, , ))
print(combined_plot)
```



Figure 2. Mean % Low Income, mean percentile for PM2.5, and mean percentile for low life expectancy by HOLC Grade

There is a clear spatial pattern of historical redlining neighborhoods in LA. According to the HOLC grade mapping (Figure 1), neighborhoods with grades C and D are widely distributed but concentrated in the central part of LA. In contrast, neighborhoods with grades A and B are mainly distributed in the north and edge parts of LA. The statistics of census block groups (Table 1) show a similar pattern, from which census blocks with grades C (34%) were mostly distributed, followed by grade D (15%), grade B (14%), and grade A (5%).

The mean % low income, mean percentile for PM2.5 and mean percentile for low life expectancy show the same increase trend with the HOLC grade getting worse (Figure 2). This trend means that people living in worse grade neighborhoods tend to have lower income, but higher exposure to PM2.5 and lower life expectancy.

## Part 2: Legacy of redlining in biodiversity observations

Redlining has not only affected the environments communities are exposed to but also shaped our observations of biodiversity (Ellis-Soto et al., 2023).

**Objective:** Explore the legacy of historical redlining in Los Angeles on the collection of bird observations.

### 1. Join datasets and summarize bird observation within each HOLC grade



```{r}
# Find bird observation records within HOLC grade 
# Include records on the boundaries
HOLC_bird_LA <- st_join(HOLC_grade_valid, gbif_birds_LA, join = st_intersects)

# Summarize bird observation within each HOLC grade
# Exclude observation without HOLC grade (marked as none)
summary_bird <- HOLC_bird_LA %>%
  filter(!is.na(grade)) %>%
  group_by(grade) %>%
  summarize(bird = n()/nrow(HOLC_bird_LA[!is.na(HOLC_bird_LA$grade), ]),
            .groups = 'drop')
```



### 2. Plot the percent of observations within redlined neighborhoods within each HOLC grade



```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# Make labels for pie plot and calculate suitable positions for them
summary_bird <- summary_bird %>%
  arrange(desc(grade)) %>%
  mutate(cumulative = cumsum(bird) - bird / 2,
         bird_label = scales::percent(bird, accuracy = 0.1))

# Draw pie plot
Bird_observation <- 
  ggplot(summary_bird, 
         aes(x = "", y = bird, fill = grade)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y", start = 0) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("forestgreen","cornflowerblue",
                               "goldenrod1","firebrick3"),
                    name = "HOLC Grade") +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(bird, accuracy = 0.1), 
                y = cumulative), 
            color = "white", 
            size = 4) +
  theme_void()
print(Bird_observation)
```



Figure 3. The percent of bird observations within redlined neighborhoods within each HOLC grade

These results do not match the findings from Ellis-Soto et al. 2023 very well. According to Ellis-Soto et al. 2023, sampling density (bird records per km2) is lowest in HOLC D neighborhoods across 195 US cities. However, our result shows that blue neighborhoods with grade B have the lowest bird observation (18.2 %), followed by grade D (22.8%) and grade A (22.9 %). Yellow neighborhoods with grade C (36.1%) have surprisingly high bird observation records.

This difference could be due to 1. the difference caused by the focus study area (195 cities vs. one city); 2. the difference in bird observation measurement - Ellis-Soto et al. 2023 used sampling density but we only focused on the percent of bird observations. The next step should be to consider the area of each HOLC grade and calculate the observation density of each HOLC grade.
