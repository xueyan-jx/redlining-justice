# Project Description

The United States has a long history of racial segregation which is still visible. The "redlining" of neighborhoods has had wide consequences for community wealth and health (Gee, 2008).
Redlining has not only affected the environments communities are exposed to but also shaped our observations of biodiversity (Ellis-Soto et al., 2023).

Thus, there are mainly two objectives in this project: 
(1) Explore historical redlining in Los Angeles and its legacy on present-day environmental justice.
(2) Explore the legacy of historical redlining in Los Angeles on the collection of bird observations.
